## 🎯 How It Works

### Image Upload Process
1. **Select Image** → User chooses profile image
2. **Compression** → Automatically compressed to ~200KB (90% size reduction)
3. **GitHub Upload** → Uploaded to your repository via GitHub API
4. **URL Generation** → GitHub provides a CDN URL for your image
5. **Local Reference** → URL stored locally for fast access

### File Structure in GitHub
```
your-username/ag-genius-profiles/
└── profiles/
    ├── user123_1640995200000.jpg
    ├── user456_1640995300000.jpg
    └── user789_1640995400000.jpg
```

### Image Optimization
- **Automatic Compression**: 2MB → ~200KB (90% reduction)
- **Smart Resizing**: Maximum 500x500px
- **Format Optimization**: Converts to JPEG for best compression
- **Quality Balance**: 80% quality for optimal size/quality ratio

- Supports create, update, and delete operations
- Handles file versioning automatically
- Includes proper error handling and validation

### Security Features
- Token stored locally (never transmitted to AgGenius servers)

- Personal access tokens can be revoked anytime
- No server-side storage of credentials

### Performance Benefits

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

### What's Public vs Private
- **Public Repository**: Images are publicly accessible via URL (recommended)
- **Private Repository**: Only you can access images (requires token for viewing)
- **Personal Access Token**: Stored only on your device, never shared

### Best Practices
- Use public repository for profile images (they need to be web-accessible)
- Keep personal access token secure (treat like a password)
- Regularly review and rotate tokens
- Only grant minimal required permissions (repo scope)

### Data Control
- You own the repository and all images
- Can delete images anytime
- Can revoke access tokens anytime
- Can make repository private anytime

## 💡 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Repository not found"**
- ✅ Make sure repository name is correct
- ✅ Repository must exist before configuring AgGenius
- ✅ Check repository is public or token has access

**"Invalid GitHub token"**
- ✅ Make sure token hasn't expired
- ✅ Check token has "repo" scope
- ✅ Try regenerating a new token

**"Upload failed"**
- ✅ Check internet connection
- ✅ Verify image is under 3MB
- ✅ Try uploading a different image format

**"Image not displaying"**
- ✅ Public repositories work best for web images
- ✅ Wait a moment for GitHub CDN to update
- ✅ Try refreshing the page

### Rate Limits
- GitHub allows 5,000 API requests per hour
- AgGenius uses 1 request per image upload
- More than enough for normal usage

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Multiple Users
- Each user gets their own folder: `profiles/userXXX_timestamp.jpg`
- No conflicts between different users
- Easy to manage and organize

### Image Versioning
- GitHub automatically tracks image history
- Old images are preserved in git history
- Can view/restore previous versions if needed

### Backup Strategy
- Images stored in git repository = automatic backup
